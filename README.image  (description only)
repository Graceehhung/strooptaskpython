The image file consists of name as the below: color_word.png
The participant will recieved the correct answer if the successfully identifed the color instead of word:
        ex: red_blue.png ... the answer is correct if the participant answers red

the total list of file names are as the below:
image_files = {
    'red': {'red': 'red_red.png', 'green': 'red_green.png', 'blue': 'red_blue.png'},
    'green': {'red': 'green_red.png', 'green': 'green_green.png', 'blue': 'green_blue.png'},
    'blue': {'red': 'blue_red.png', 'green': 'blue_green.png', 'blue': 'blue_blue.png'}
}


We use image loading files instead of code generating files due to the complication of Psychopy's ability to naturaly process 
Chinese across different system and platform. 
In that case we wrote the whole code part in English, and anything Chinese in alternative image files to maintain the stability.
Feel free to try it though ;)))

The image file also only consist of one word instead of the normal lingustic choice of two word:
        Ex: 紅 instead of 紅色, 綠 instead of 綠色, 藍 instead of 藍色
We purposefully chosen the approach due to the percieved possible strategy among participants of only identifying the color of 色
Instead of the original intention of suppressing inhibition
